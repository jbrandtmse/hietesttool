notes: |
  Story 3.4 is a documentation-heavy story with exceptional deliverables. The templates are 
  production-ready, well-documented, and integrate seamlessly with the existing template engine 
  from Stories 3.1-3.3. The comprehensive documentation (docs/ccd-templates.md) and quick start 
  guide (docs/quickstart-templates.md) provide excellent resources for end users. Integration 
  testing is thorough with 20 tests covering validation, personalization, caching, and documentation 
  verification. No code refactoring needed as this story creates artifacts rather than modifying 
  existing code. This is exemplary work that significantly enhances user experience.
