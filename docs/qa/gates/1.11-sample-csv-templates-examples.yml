# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Add integration test to validate sample files programmatically"
      refs: ["tests/integration/test_sample_csv_files.py"]
      rationale: "Prevents regression if CSV parser behavior changes"
    - action: "Consider explicitly saving patients_minimal.csv as UTF-8"
      refs: ["examples/patients_minimal.csv"]
      rationale: "Currently ASCII (valid) but explicit UTF-8 would be more consistent"
